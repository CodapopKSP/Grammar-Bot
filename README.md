# Grammar Bot

Grammar Bot is a random sentence generation tool that builds grammatically-correct sentences out of constituent parts, mostly consisting of root words and instructions on how to achieve the correct permutations of those words. This is an ongoing project that may eventually be useful, perhaps for generating sentences for teaching or language development.
